# seniorDesign

This project contains the files for my senior design project, the storm analysis tool. The project was a website that allowed for visual analysis of a database from the National Climate Data Center (see: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/). The visualization is done through table, graph, and heat map format, and allow users to query the data they want to visualize from the database. Technologies include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python with Flask, and SQL.
