OB'To-Do:

Finish the build_tree function -- done on 1/26/17
Finish the doesRectIntersectPolygon function -- done on 2/14/17
Finish the grid initialization code -- done on 2/15/17
Write the code that takes in the Barnes-Hut tree, and a ScoreGrid object, and scores each point in the "grid" -- done on 2/16/17

At this point, I think it would be best to write a C program that takes in the polygon from a file (as a list of lat-lon ponits), and a list of storm events (with lat-lon, and some associated storm damage), and some other params, and outputs a list of scored points as a file. Then, a Python script will read this file, and put a map together.

Though, I'm wondering if it might be possible/advantageous to keep the latitude and longitude (instead of converting everything to cartesian), and use the distance function found in shape.c in the barnes hut algorithm.

Is this even possible? If so, I think we should do it. My new to-do is to check if this is possible.

After reviewing, I think it's possible, but yields a big problem: "quadrants" (rectangles) become weirdly shaped on latitude-longitude coordinates. Let's only do this if the conversion from lat/lon to cartesian and back yields serious issues. 


NO, IT ISN'T POSSIBLE!

We need to project using the COBE Quadrilatilized Spherical Cube (see: http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/ccs.pdf and https://github.com/cix/QuadSphere/tree/master/lib/quad_sphere)


TODO for quadrilaterized spherical cube model:
1) Write code to convert latitude, longitude face, x, y
2) Modify barnes hut construction to use projection.


Write code in shape.c to convert cartesian to latitude/longitude.
Write code in grid.c to convert a ScoreGrid in cartesian to a ScoreGrid in latitude/longitude.


Write code that takes in a list of storm events, computes the Body objects, builds the tree, and computes scores on a grid.
Write makefile
Make sure quadrant height and width are set correctly -- done on 1/26/17 
Make sure we don't attemp to create quadrants with size less than 1 -- done on 1/26/17
